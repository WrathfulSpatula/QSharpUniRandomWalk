This is a simple example of quantum mechanics simulation in quantum computational logic. It is essentially a unidirectional binary quantum random walk algorithm, from a positive starting point, heading toward zero.

We assume a fixed length time step. During each time step, we step through an equal superposition of either standing still or taking one fixed length step from our current position toward our fixed destination.

This is equivalent to a physical body having a 50% chance of emitting a fixed unit of energy in a fixed time, in a pure quantum state. Hence, it might be considered a simple quantum mechanics simulation.
